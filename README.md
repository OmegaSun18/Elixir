# Elixir
Elixir is a 2-D interactive game in which the player interacts with a graphic user interface with a mouse to choose different paths in the story. The project is built by @Eman3000-bruh and I in our last year of high school.
Elxir was built in python as the primary language. Using various python extensions such as tKinter and Pillow, we have created a graphic user interface for the player to interact with using thier mouse to navigate through the game.
At the back end we have used MySQL to create a local datebase on the player's system to keep track of their choices and to ensure that the story flows properly.
All the story is stored inside small binary files as to break up the story into chunks so that teh program can have proper breakpoints.

IMPORTANT:
To run the game on your system, you must have MySQL and python libraries such as Pillow and tKinter downloaded. You must open the main python file and change the userid and password to reflect the ones that you have set on you system.
Screen resolution should be set to 1366x768 for optimal viewing.
