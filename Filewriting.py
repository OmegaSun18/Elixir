s1="The year is 2100, humanity has mastered the secrets of Artificial intelligence, Genetic Modification, Mystical Artifacts, and is steadily approaching a tier 2 civilization. Humanity was on the cusp of cracking the essence of immortality, but as a wise man once said never mess with Mother Nature, or else there will be consequences. Heed the warning they didn't, they forged on thinking themselves as mini gods, creating and flourishing life on the moon, as well as enhancing the species on Earth to greater heights. Then came the point where nature finally rebelled. Our story begins in the mystical village of Daldar, where a well-known Scientist and her group had found the last piece to immortality, The Trinket of Mighty Ice Phoenix. Returning to the capital city of Certia, they successfully integrated the trinket into their existing research to forge the elixir of life. The so-called elixir when administered into the heart provides immortality to the subject. They had finally done it, they were able to do the impossible, they had found the key to immortality. They ran some tests on lab rats and got positive results. After a few weeks of rigorous testing on lab rats to make sure the elixir had no side effects, they called for a press conference to showcase their findings to the world."

s2="In a white sparkling room, small bubbling sounds were heard. A gentle hum of the adjacent AC unit reverberated through the room, enveloping the three people in the room with a gentle chill. The three people in white coats were moving around in a brisk manner, inspecting a set of vials with a bluish liquid emitting an eerie glow. One of the Scientists, a short woman in a white lab coat, was supervising the other two men, stepped around them, and moved back to the monitor at the corner of the room. Her short black hair, with a gradient touch of dark purple at one side, the overhead lights illuminating her hair with a matt look. Her piercing red eyes shifting across the screen, scanning the information written there. A Scientist walked up behind her carrying one of the vials in a clamp."
s3="Man - Ms Luna, we’ve isolated the sample we are going to use for the test."
s4="Lu*De* - Good, put the vial in the storage unit, we need to ensure nothing goes wrong with the sample."
s5="The Scientist nodded his head and moved to where the other Scientist was moving the set of vials into a room. Luna supervised and turned back to the monitor, sat down on a chair, and started checking the details again. While she was engrossed in scrolling through the details, a tall woman walked into the room also wearing a white lab coat. She was looking around the room with her lovely green eyes and spotted a figure hunched over a monitor. The woman walks up to the figure and puts her arms over them. Luna jerked back surprised, but instantly calmed down seeing who it was."

The elixir was completed and through various lab trials with mice, the first human test trial was scheduled tomorrow. Lily turned her head back to Luna, only to see Luna staring up at her as well."

s22="The next day, the world was a buzz of excitement. News channels all over the world were repeatedly talking about the same topic: the discovery of immortality by a group of Scientists, and the implications of their discovery. Holo-screens blared out constantly and people could be heard chatting excitedly everywhere. In a small apartment a man around the age of 38 was going through his morning routine. He grunted as he completed his morning workout. Satisfied, he jogged to the bathroom to freshen up. He exited feeling refreshed and put on his usual army tank top, with his dark green denims. He ran his hand through his blackish brown hair as he moved to gather up his keys for his car."
s23="Before leaving his apartment, he thought to himself for a minute, and went back into his bedroom, shrugged on a rustic looking coat, picked up a pair of sunglasses, and left the apartment. He got in his pick-up truck and started driving along the smooth roads. Around 30 minutes later, he arrived at another apartment complex. There waiting for him was a small group of people. One of the girls named Wally, around the age of 17, perked her head when he turned into the parking lot."

The sight of Scientist 3’s intestines, blood, flesh, and organs strewn everywhere nauseated him. Now, Chandler, or the mass of convulsing and pulsing mass of flesh that was once Chandler, turns to Scientist 4 and rips him apart using the tentacles. Slowly a head-like appendage starts to take shape on Chandler. At the death of two of his fellow scientists, Scientist 2 trembles as he falls onto the ground and slowly starts to back away. Chandler turns to Scientist 5, who was still vomiting, and grabs him and violently slams him into the ceiling, killing him instantly. The head-like appendage slowly splits into 3 and Scientist 5’s remains slowly fall on top of Chandler’s body. Scientist 2, unable to contain his voice, whimpers in fear."

A survivor once recounted the absolute horror he saw that day. He recounted with a shaky voice about what he saw. One single fleshy beast eating and killing humans left and right; screams of his dying comrades, innocent civilians, and children filled his ears; blood raining from the sky; the piles of lifeless bodies growing each minute, no, every second; the smell of the corpses assaulted his nose; and hopelessness filling his heart. He was one of the few unlucky people who got a glimpse of this monstrosity. Blood dripped from its body, tendons and flesh oozing out of one of its heads. A primeval fear gripped the man after witnessing this scene."

In the ensuing explosion, everything is wiped from the map in a 20 km radius. But Chandler survives, partly due to burrowing underground as far as he could before the explosion. Humanity tries firing more warheads, but this time Chandler has mutated and adapted. Humanity has made another mistake in trying to kill Chandler."

The plan initially works, and Chandler is lured in. The rocket takes off and it seems that the plan has worked.

Now Chandler mutates again to survive high heat and a slight aversion to such traps."

As they become close to the villagers, they also start to trust them and slowly start revealing what they did for a living. They give the villagers a little hint of them being scientists and start sharing the amount of knowledge they have with regards to science and technology which impresses the villagers. As more days go on, the villagers start thinking of them as some kind of hush status people due to their knowledge and their ability to build a few tools just by using that knowledge even when there is a lack of resources. That is when the villagers felt that this group should start leading them, as they all feel the village should be led by someone who has more knowledge than what they have. So the villagers tell this to the group, even though the group was hesitant at first, they agreed to it."
s320="?* - As they slowly succeeded in their efforts to develop the village they started liking the idea of leading the village and the villagers following them and showering them with love and kindness. However, there was one person who liked it a bit too much, in fact so much that it was reaching a point of dangerous obsession. Of course you can't expect everyone to agree with you right? Not everybody would be willing to let a total stranger lead them right? Nor would everyone agree to everything someone would tell them to do because in the end everyone has a different approach towards things. "

I am an embodiment of kindness. And if they refuse my help a second time, then I will forgive. I will still help them. I … will help them over and over until they accept it."

I am so very kind...giggle....’ a small voice sounded out from a dark figure crouched near a makeshift.
